#Functionality - 2
Half of my command line interface is not implemented correctly

#Object Oriented Programming - 2
If I had more time, I would have liked to split up the functionality into
different modules. For example, encrypt and decrypt both used a key and date,
then rotated the letters in a given message using a collection of letters. This
makes me think that the rotation process could be its own module.
Generating keys, offsets, and shifts could also be part of a separate class that
only generates arrays for each given category.

#Ruby Conventions and Mechanics - 2.5
As I got more and more tired, I may have started naming things not as clearly as
I would have wanted. XD

#Test Driven Development - 2
I intended to address edge cases once I began working on splitting the work into the
different components, however, I ran out of time. My test coverage is high.

#Version Control - 2
I have a few commits that with multiple functionality as I started to run out of time.
Because of this, I give myself a two. With more time, I would commit every time a test
is passed, so as to keep things separately.
